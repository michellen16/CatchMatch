This project was my group's and I submission for the 2025 UIC SparkHacks Hackathon. Given the prompt, to come up with a solution that will help a small business, we decided to target the fishing industry.
With a group of four, we were tasked with coming up a solution to the prompt that would also be presentable for a judge to review within a strict deadline. Our website allows small fishing businesses to 
pick their preferences (cost, materials, location, etc) and match them with a supplier that fits all their needs. 

I was tasked with the majority of the frontend code. I came up with the theme, visuals, how the website should be navigated, and what features to implement in our program to help make it stand out.
I also helped assist with some of the backend code, mostly functions that would work with the visuals. 

This project demonstrates our skills in CSS, HTML, Tailwind, and Javascript.

Both the frontend and backend code can be found in the "src" folder.
